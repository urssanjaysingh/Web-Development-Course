<!-- Accessibility is the practice of ensuring websites are accessible to the largest number
    of users possible.

>> Some users may need assistive technologies like screen readers or zooming devices that need 
    coding support to access content.

>> But accessibility is not only about screen readers. It also helps users who use different
    devices or have slow internet connections.

>> One of the ways to code accessible websites is by using semantic HTML.

>> Generic HTML tags like div and span are containers. However, they don't provide context. 
    Other tags are meaningful, like h1, ul or body.

>> A <button> is a better option than <div> element. 

>> HTML order is important use ranks for headings like h1, h2, h3 and so on. 

>> Webpage must only have one h1 heading.

>> We must use the correct tags for their purpose. For example, <button> when there's an action and
    <a> when there's a redirection. It's important to use descriptive action calls for buttons.

>> Alternative texts give context to screen readers and provide useful descriptions when images fail 
    to load. Use alt attribute.

>> Another helpful attribute is lang. When we define it correctly in the html tag, it helps screen 
    readers know what language to use. -->
