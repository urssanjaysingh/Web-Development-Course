/**React is a JavaScript library, a collection of code scripts and functions that can be used for
 *  building your own code.
 *      npm install react
 *  React uses JSX(JavaScript XML).
 *  JSX is a markup syntax that combines User Interface(UI) elements and logic.
 *  Unlike HTML, we can use variables inside JSX.
 *  We can also use variables to insert JSX into other elements. We do that with the help of 
 *      embedded expressions like {variable}.
 *  Embedded expressions are values wrapped in between curly braces {} inside of existing JSX elements.
 *  We can even use Embedded Expressions to pass values into a JSX element's attributes.
 *  
 *  Use the following procedure to create a react app:
 *      npm install -g create-react-app
 *      npx create-react-app my-app
 *          cd my-app
 *          npm start
 */
