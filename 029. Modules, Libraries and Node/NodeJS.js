/*
>>  Node.js is an open-source runtime environment that enables developers 
    to use JavaScript on the server-side.
>>  Node.js also enables developers to import libraries and other modules into a project without using 
    a separate script tag in the HTML

>>  The power NodeJS brought to the development community is huge. Developers can now create full-stack
    applications using only JavaScript.
>>  Full-stack development means building both the front-end and the back-end of an application.

>>  To install Node on your machine, you first need to download it from the NodeJS website.
>>  Ensure Node is installed in your computer by typing node -v in a terminal. v stands for version.

>>  JS has many libraries or frameworks to help build out applications. These modules are contained
    in packages.
>>  We can handle packages with a package manager. A popular one is NPM.
>>  The Node Package Manager, npm, is an open-source repository where you can find lots of useful 
    packages to install in your projects.
>>  npm comes pre-installed with your NodeJS installation. You can check its version using npm -v.

>>  To create a NodeJS project, we need to initialize the project.
>>  Since npm manages our Node packages, we use the command npm init to create the project.
        npm init
>>  You can quickly create a new React project by running the following command in your terminal:
        npm init react-app my-app

Note: install the following:
        npm install bootstrap
        npm install express
        npm install moment
        npm install react-router-dom@6
