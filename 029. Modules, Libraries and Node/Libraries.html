<!-- There are libraries in JS, we can borrow code written by others  
    and also contribute with our code for others to use.
>>  Libraries are usually stored in Content Delivery Network.
>>  CDN is a network that delivers web content quickly by serving it from a nearby server.
>>  We can use a library CDN by including it in the src attribute of the script tag from our HMTL file. -->
