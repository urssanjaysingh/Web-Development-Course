<!-- DOM stands for Document Object Model
    Tree data structures is use to represent data and relationships in a hierarchical way.
In HTML, the document tree allows us to better see the relationships between the elements.
We represent elements in an HTML document as nodes of the tree.
Elements like p are called element nodes. We consider the text inside text-nodes.
We refer to nodes as being in a parent-child relationship if they are connected and there are no 
other nodes between them.
Two nodes are siblings if they share the same parent, like h1 and p. -->
